# Hey, I'm Arsh! 🧑‍🔬

I am a TypeScript expert specializing in developer tools. After becoming a serial contributor to Astro, I was invited into the core team. I implemented build-time optimizations, improved SSR production-readyness on Cloudflare Workers, Vercel, and Netlify, and optimized lighthouse performance. I also regularly contribute to the web ecosystem: [Oxlint (Rust)](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/issues/14564#issuecomment-3419208008), [VS Code (TypeScript)](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-css-languageservice/pull/421), [Terrazzo (React)](https://github.com/terrazzoapp/terrazzo/pull/428), [Deno (Rust)](https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/28451), and [Caddy (Go)](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/pull/6765).

I am currently making [Oxlint](https://voidzero.dev/posts/announcing-oxlint-1-stable) compatible with the industry-standard ESLint. This involves wrangling lesser-known but powerful code analysis tools into a large and constantly-in-flux Rust/TypeScript interop codebase, all while ensuring optimal runtime performance. Recently delivered features: [token APIs](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/pull/15861), [scope manager API](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/pull/14890), [comment APIs](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/issues/14564#issuecomment-3419208008), [settings API](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/pull/14724).

I have also built [MagicServer](https://magicserver.arsh.sh/docs): easy, automatic HTTPS for Node.js applications. Issues and rotates X.509 certificates provided by Let's Encrypt and other Certificate Authorities. Built with a modern and robust ACME client (RFC 8555) written specifically for MagicServer!

I write blog posts about my fun experiments in frontend, backend, and devtool engineering. Here's one on [why and how I built my own React metaframework](https://arsh.sh/posts/why-i-built-my-own-metaframework/).

_Interested in what I do? I am currently open to full-time roles in full-stack, developer tooling and ecosystem engineering._
