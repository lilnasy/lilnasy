# Hey, I'm Arsh! üßë‚Äçüî¨

**I am a neuroscience major who got into open-source to make a thoughtful impact outside of the lab.**

_I am currently looking for full-time oppurtunities._

After becoming a serial contributor to Astro, I was invited into the core team, where I implemented build-time reduction strategies, improved SSR production-readyness on Cloudflare Workers, Vercel, and Netlify, and optimized lighthouse performance. I also regularly contribute to the web ecosystem: [VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-css-languageservice/pull/421), [Terrazzo](https://github.com/terrazzoapp/terrazzo/pull/428), [Deno](https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/28451), and [Caddy](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/pull/6765).

I am currently working on [MagicServer](https://magicserver.arsh.sh/docs).


Let me help your team! You can reach out to me at hi@arsh.sh, or [schedule a call](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/appointments/schedules/AcZssZ3ChoWFCFbrieMOvlK_JKikkb5Lky0DQ20HBwWA2e9WfEIY5K1NKk4Iul2y3pTvwHwrZ2Oy-6ba).
