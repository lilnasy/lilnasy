# Hey, I'm Arsh! üßë‚Äçüî¨

**I am a neuroscience major who got into open-source to make a thoughtful impact outside of the lab.**

I am a TypeScript expert with experience in developer tools. After becoming a serial contributor to Astro, I was invited intoto the core team. I implemented build-time optimizations, improved SSR production-readyness on Cloudflare Workers, Vercel, and Netlify, and optimized lighthouse performance. I also regularly contribute to the web ecosystem: [Oxlint (Rust)](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/issues/14564#issuecomment-3419208008), [VS Code (TypeScript)](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-css-languageservice/pull/421), [Terrazzo (React)](https://github.com/terrazzoapp/terrazzo/pull/428), [Deno (Rust)](https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/28451), and [Caddy (Go)](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/pull/6765).

I am currently working on [MagicServer](https://magicserver.arsh.sh/docs): easy, automatic HTTPS for Node.js applications. It is an automated solution for issuing and rotating X.509 certificates provided by an ACME Certificate Authority, such as Google Public and Let's Encrypt. MagicServer is powered by a modern and robust RFC 8555 compliant ACME client written specifically for MagicServer!

_Interested in what I do? I am currently open to full-time roles in developer tooling, and ecosystem engineering._
