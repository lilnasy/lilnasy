# Hey, I'm Arsh! üßë‚Äçüî¨

**I am a neuroscience major who got into open-source to make a thoughtful impact outside of the lab.**

I am a TypeScript expert with experience in developer tools. After becoming a serial contributor to Astro, I was invited intoto the core team. I implemented build-time optimizations, improved SSR production-readyness on Cloudflare Workers, Vercel, and Netlify, and optimized lighthouse performance. I also regularly contribute to the web ecosystem: [VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-css-languageservice/pull/421), [Terrazzo](https://github.com/terrazzoapp/terrazzo/pull/428), [Deno](https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/28451), and [Caddy](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/pull/6765).

I am currently working on [MagicServer](https://magicserver.arsh.sh/docs).

_Interested in what I do? I am currently open to full-time roles in developer tooling, and ecosystem engineering._
